  <h1><center>Listening Section<center></h1>
  <p>
    The listening section is made up of 6 or 9 questions and will last either 60 or 90 minutes. There are two types of questions:
    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Lecture Type</strong>: 4 or 6 lectures, each accompanied by 6 questions</li>
      <li> <strong>Conversation Type</strong>: 2 or 3 conversations, each accompanied by 5 questions. </li>
    </ol>
    Each listening question will start with a clip of a lecture or conversation. After the clip, you will be asked 5 or 6 questions related to the clip. Note that you will not know the questions while you listen, and you will not be able to listen again to the full recording while doing questions.

  <h2><center><strong>Lecture Type</strong></center></h2>
    <p>
      The lectures can come from any academic discipline â€” in short, almost anything a freshman could take a class in, except math or mathematical sciences, like physics.
    </p>

  <br>
  <h2><center>Conversation Type<center></h2>
  <p>
    The conversations are either:
    <ul>
      <li>between a student and a professor during office hours, or </li>
      <li>between a student and some member of support staff/university administration.</li>
    </ul>
    Often the second kind of conversation deals with topics like course registration, graduation requirements, and financial aid.
