  </h1>
  <p>
    The reading section is made up of 3 or 4 passages from academic texts. It contains around 36-56 questions and lasts around
    60-80 minutes, depending upon the number of passages. In all, that's roughly 20 minutes per passage and one to two minutes
    per question. There are three types of questions:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Multiple Choice</strong>: Most Reading questions are standard multiple choice. These questions are each worth 1 raw
        point and give you four answer choices to choose from.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Inserting a sentence</strong>: You’ll get one Inserting a Sentence question, worth 1 raw point, with each passage.
        This question is always the second-to-last question in a question set (right before the Reading to Learn question,
        which we discuss more below).
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Reading to learn</strong>
        This is perhaps one of the most unique question types on the TOEFL. The Reading to Learn question requires you to arrange
        the main points of the passage in a chart or summary by clicking and dragging sentences.
        <br> There is only one Reading to Learn question per passage, and it’ll always come at the end of a question set. In
        addition, this is the only Reading question type worth 2-3 raw points, meaning you can get partial credit if you
        only get some of the answers correct.
